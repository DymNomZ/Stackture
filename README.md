# Stackture - Structure Your Stack

An application that guides learners through a precise problem-focused strategy.

**Project Goal/Purpose:** 

Stackture targets SDG 4, "Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.‚Äù

Humans are the most important resources worth cultivating sustainably. Beyond ecosystems, economies, and industries, developing human minds and skills for future generations will be the most beneficial investment we can make in the present. To assist the youth of this generation undergoing education, Stackture aims to be a study tool that offers precise guidance in solving problems, overcoming learning gaps, and reaching goals.

**Main Features:** 

I. Precisely Structured Study Plans

Stackture designs personalized roadmaps and study guides for its users. The unique feature here is that a user must provide a **goal** or **problem**. After all, learning tools and skills are for solving problems. The app will create a *node* for the **root problem** provided by the user.

Next, a survey will be conducted, giving the learner a chance to honestly assess their understanding of the problem. The app uses the results of this assessment to generate *branch nodes* which are subproblems or prerequisites needed to solve the root problem. The root problem is only solved once all branches are "resolved".

The learner can attempt to "resolve" a branch by taking an assessment for the problem at that branch. If their understanding of the subproblem is graded as sufficient, they may close the branch and move on to study and resolve other branches. When all branches of the root are closed and resolved, the learner can then attempt to resolve the root problem.

If the learner finds a problem at a branch too large or difficult to understand, they may "split" the branch into further sub-branches. They can repeatedly divide and conquer until they resolve all key areas of a problem.
